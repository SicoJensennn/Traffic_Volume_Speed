This is a repository I used to process vehicle/transportation data which is required for emissions.


`VIUS\shapefile`:
contains all the files required in the QGIS.

`VIUS\vius_whole_US`:
combines all the sheets together and form a dataframe.

`VIUS\vius_weight_combine`:
contains codes I used to process data.

`VIUS\state_avg_weight`:
contains 2 columns: State name and average weight.
